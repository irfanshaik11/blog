I've seen plenty of founders flame out, especially in crypto. The news is scattered with founders that pushed the bar a little too far, flew a little too close to the sun and irreparably damaged their careers or even ended up in jail.

Vinod Khosla believes "Failure does not matter, only success matters". This is caveated by Elon, "Failure does not matter unless its catastrophic". This seems to be the correct advice. 

Crypto founding can feel like straddling the Catastrophic, so to feel better, I'll try to define it narrowly.

How do we define catastrophic?

- Bankman Fried is obviously catastrophic, he's in jail for 20+ years. Don't steal billions of dollars.
- Neel Somani's reputation is ruined permanently in exchange for $8M dollars. Is that irreperable damage?

          - It probably limits him from most ventures in the tradfi world, and probably totally eliminates his chance of running a genuine billion dollar company. But if we're guessing from his behavior, he didn't really ever intend to do so. 

          - Probably his career aims are within the 10s of Ms range. If we narrowly define his aims in this lens, he's obtained enough to effectively retire and invest / advise.

          - What's his next move? Guessing from Ian M (the infamous solana developer), I'd guess he'd base offshore and attempt to reappear in a year withing crypto. Likely he'll hang around the fringees of crypto for a bit.

          - Thus this isn't catastrophic damange

Vivek Ramaswamy

        - Created a sketchy alzheimer's drug company and committed the typical pump the drug research, sell equity before it ultimately fails.

        - Is this catastrophic failure? According to him, no. He said he cried a little but realized that despite his billion dollar company failing he was surprised by the total lack of consequences.

        - Successful political career after.

Elizabeth Holmes
      - I'd say its catastrophic.


Thus the conclusion seems, outside of explicitly committing fraud for several billion, there aren't that many consequences for failure. I think the only thing to really fear is fear itself.
