# All Long Term Value in Crypto Stems From Decentralization

There's levels to decentralization. Bitcoin and Ethereum are 'de jure' decentralized, its impossible for a centralized entity (without a few hundred billion) or a nation (outside of coordination from a top few) to successfully shut down the network.

Other chains are 'de facto' decentralized, there might be some physical limitation that adds a layer of centralization, like the large stake & validator requirements of most high TPS chains, or a multisig governing the chain like most L2s, or not a large enough userbase running validators. 

We trust that the majority owners of the token and the community behind behind the chain has enough incentive to abide by the chain's rules. Code is not entirely law but there's enough social incentive to abide by the written code. There's a limit to this, which limits the amount of value that can actually be stored on chain. 

If there was a hundred billion on a multisig governed L2 for example, one might believe that the incentive to collude is greater than the incentive to keep the chain going. 

For that reason, the functional level of decentralization of a chain fundamentally limits the amount of value that can be stored on the chain. Chains seek to increase their decentralization over time in order to increase the value on their chain and the value of the chain.

The closer a chain gets to true 'code is law' the more valuable it is. Therefore, the projects that add the most long term value are those that functionally increase decentralization.

The only use case for crypto is as a decentralized store of data. All value in crypto fundamentally stems from this, so logically the projects that contribute the most value are the ones that positively affect decentralization.
